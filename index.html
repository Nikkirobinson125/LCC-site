    <p>I will add starting pages for the web demos. When you open them, you can
        download the files to use as starting point. Or you can View Source and
        copy/paste snippets into your existing code.</p>

        
    <!-- 
    structure of a link:
    <a> is an anchor and tells the browser to go somewhere
    href="filename" tells the browser where to go
    target="_blank" tells the browser to open it in a new blank tab
    <a>the visual element that becomes the link</a>

    notes: 
    * make sure the file is in the same folder as index.html and the filename is written correctly. 

    * no spaces are allowed in file names so use dashes instead: file-name.html

    <p>this is paragraph text.</p>

    <!-- the assignment sheet lists a bunch of different tags for text elements and basic formatting. i want you to fill in this document with all of those elements. 
    
    some of the tags are for actual text elements and some are inline, meaning you apply them inside of text elements. the following text element has an inline italic applied -->
    <p>this paragraph text has <em>italic text</em> as inline formatting.</p>

    <p class="class">
      this paragraph text has a class of "class" applied so the css rule .class
      will affect it. you can have many elements with .class applied
    </p>

    <p id="id" class="class">
      this paragraph text has a class of "class" applied so the css rule .class
      will affect it. you can have many elements with .class applied. it also
      has an id of "id" applied. you only get to use each id once in a page.
      note the id overwrites the rule for the class.
    </p>

    <p class="class2 class">
      this paragraph text has both classes of "class" and "class2" applied. it
      is red because "class2" is listed last in the css list and so it
      overwrites what values were defined before.
    </p>

    <p>this paragraph text has <span class="class2">a span with "class2" applied</span> as inline formatting.</p>

    <p>
      you can right-click and hit "view page source" to see the code. copy/paste
      snippets into your own code or save the entire document to your files to
      get started.
